Round elected is the round in which the candidate reached more than 50% of the vote.

Results page adds a repetitive round whenever a winner is reached before the final round. I removed that round. So there will be one less round in json files than on the results page.

Multiple elimination round transfer patterns could not be determined and those fields were left empty in the json file.
